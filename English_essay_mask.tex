\section{Introduction}
 People worries they could caught in covid19. In korea, more than 300 thousands people have caught in a day. The government announced that people should wear their masks and obey the rules to prevent being infected. However, some people doubt the effectiveness of wearing mask or even prevention the government suggests. Needless to say, I strongly agree people should wear their masks on wherever they are. \\

\section{Body 1}
 Comparing South Korea and other countries,  It is true that some western countries discard their prevention and let people freely walk around. There are millions of self-ownership in Korea who still suffer from the government' strict restrictions. Although vaccination has some effect on preventing covid19 or severe danger, it is not common sense that South Korea have both high vaccination rate and more infections per day than any other countries in the world. Most of citizen experienced inconvenience because of the government's rules. People could not meet their friends or even their families. Many people lost their jobs. Wearing masks just delay the end of pandemic and we suffer more time due to prevention policy.

\section{Body 2}
people might say "wearing masks and vaccinating delay the end of pandemic". Still, it is true that wearing masks is basic prevention policy which effectively restrict the expansion of plague. When an infected person exhales, talks, coughs or sneezes, the virus spreads through the air. When we meet covid19 virus, the virus penetrates into our respiratory system. The virus first meets our nose or mouth, then it goes into our body through trachea. Next, the virus goes into our lungs which are not identical. When virus penetrates into our lungs or sections of lungs which called 'lungs'. When virus stitches to pleura, it can cause more severe disease such as pneumonia. Wearing mask is the simplest way to prevent virus dives into our lungs. Masks protect us from a spray, sneeze which can infectious.

\section{Conclusion}
There are arguments for and against about wearing masks, I agree with wearing masks is effective.
